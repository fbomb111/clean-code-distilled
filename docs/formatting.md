# Formatting

*"Clean code can be read, and enhanced, by a developer other than its original author.  It has unit and acceptance tests.  It has meaningful names.  It provides one way rather than many ways for doing one thing." - 'Big' Dave Thomas, founder of OTI, godfather of the Eclipse strategy*

* Consistently apply formatting rules
* If you're on a team agree to a single set of rules and comply
* Automatted tools can help apply formatting rules for you

### The purpose of formatting
Formatting is about communication.  Style and disclipline survives in the project even after your code has been refactored.

### Vertical formatting
In the example of FitNesse, a project with 50,000 lines, files are typically 200 lines long with an upper limit of 500.  It's not a rule, but signifies that significant systems can be built with small files.  Smaller files are easier to understand than larger ones.

#### The newspaper metaphor
In a well-written article, the top gives you an idea what the story is about, the first paragraph gives you a synopsis of the story, as you continue down details increase.  A source file should be like an article, the name telling whether we're in the right spot, the top giving high level concepts, details and low level functions toward the bottom.

#### Vertical openess between concepts
